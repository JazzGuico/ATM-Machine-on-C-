# ATM-Machine-on-C-
This C++ program is a simple console-based bank account management system that allows users to input account details, deposit and withdraw money, check balance, and view account information through a menu-driven interface using global variables and basic input/output operations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This C++ console application simulates a basic bank account management system. It allows a user to:

Enter account details (name, account number, and initial balance)

View the account information

Deposit money into the account

Withdraw money from the account

Check the current balance

Exit the program

The system uses global variables to store account information and provides a simple text-based menu interface that continuously loops until the user chooses to exit. Each operation clears the screen (using system("cls")) before displaying its interface.

Features:
Menu-driven interface for user interaction

Input handling for account creation, deposits, and withdrawals

Real-time balance updates after each transaction
